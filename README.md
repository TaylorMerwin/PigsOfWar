# PigsOfWar
Pigs Of War is a twist on the classic probability dice game Pig. This game makes use of a deck of cards and a pair of dice. Pigs Of War supports both single and two players. 

Gameplay:

On each player’s turn, the player will draw a card, with the card’s rank determining how many rolls of the dice the player may make on their turn. The player then rolls the dice, and the sum of their dice rolls are added to their turn’s score. If the player rolls a one their score is reset for the turn, if they roll double ones their score for the entire game is reset! The player must decide if they will continue to roll the dice, increasing their risk/reward, or save, locking in their score and ending their turn. The first player to reach the target score wins.
